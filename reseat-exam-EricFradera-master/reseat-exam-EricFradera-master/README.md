## Sending messages

This is a very simple messaging application to send messages between users. As always follow
the TODO comments.

The first thing you should do after cloning the repository is to run the application to be sure 
it works. The url "/" goes to the index.htm that links the three available operations. Namely,
list users, list the messages of the logged in user (it doesn't work if not logged in), and 
send a new message.

The TODO 3 consists on coding the functionality of sending a new message. It is divided in three
steps that can be done (more or less) independently and will be grade in their own.

Good luck!
